# Game Controller (and Processing Demo Game)
This was an Arduino-based input device project. The game controller used a matrix keypad, a single thumbstick, a tilt sensor (this was replaceable with any 3-pin sensor,), a little buzzer, and a bunch of LEDs as indicators. 

## The Software
Arduino: This part defined serial input functionality of all the inputs, and also handled the behavior of the leds.

Processing: A little demo game made to demonstrate the controller entire range of functionality.

## The Hardware
The controller was shaped like a rectangular prism with curved edges at the front. I used a sawed-in-half clipboard for the back (horribly uncomfortable in use) and foam for the sides and top.
